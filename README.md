# Driver-Fatigue-Analysis
Driver fatigue is a significant factor in road accidents and poses a serious threat to road safety. This project aims to address this issue by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze driver fatigue based on eye state classification. The project utilizes a carefully curated dataset containing images of both open and closed eyes, allowing the model to accurately predict fatigue levels and assist in preventing potential accidents.
